STL10 VGG16 Inference UI

Overview
- Desktop GUI for running VGG16 STL-10 classifiers on the STL-10 train set
- Lets the user pick images by index, preview them, and run inference
- Shows predicted class and true label for selected indices

How it works
1) On startup the app scans the models directory and loads the list of .pt files
2) It loads the STL-10 train dataset from binary files and builds an index list
3) The user selects any number of indices from the list
4) The preview shows the selected image (rotated 90 degrees to the right)
5) On Run, the selected images are preprocessed and passed through the model
6) Results are shown in the output panel; the preview shows the last prediction

Data sources
- Train images: stl10_binary/train_X.bin
- Train labels: stl10_binary/train_y.bin
- Image size inside the binary files: 96x96x3 (uint8)

Models used
- Loads VGG16 architectures with a custom classifier head for 10 classes
- Weights are loaded from .pt files in the models directory:
  - models/vgg16_stl10_best.pt
  - models/vgg16_stl10_last.pt
  - models/vgg16_stl10_target85.pt

Preprocessing
- Images are resized to 256, center-cropped to 224
- Normalized with ImageNet mean/std:
  mean = (0.485, 0.456, 0.406)
  std  = (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)

Class mapping (index -> label)
0 airplane
1 bird
2 car
3 cat
4 deer
5 dog
6 horse
7 monkey
8 ship
9 truck

Preview behavior
- Preview rotates images 90 degrees to the right for display only
- Rotation does not affect inference unless the code is changed

How to run
- Use the project venv:
  .\venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py

Notes
- If the dataset files are missing, the app will show an error on startup
- The UI does not download data or models; it only uses local files
